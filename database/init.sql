-- Database initialization script
-- This file is executed when the PostgreSQL container starts for the first time

-- Create database if it doesn't exist (handled by POSTGRES_DB environment variable)
-- The database is automatically created by the postgres:16-alpine image

-- You can add any additional database initialization here
-- For example, creating extensions:
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- Tables will be created by Prisma migrations
